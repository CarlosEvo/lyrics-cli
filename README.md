# lyrics-cli
<p>This repo includes a version of <a href="https://github.com/nick-parry/songLyrics">songLyrics</a> with <b>DuckDuckGo</b> search and fetches song information from mpv. The other script is a enhanced version of <a href="https://github.com/xanpdx/lyric-scripts">songLyricsFormatted</a>, which shows the fetched lyrics formatted in three lines. The next three lines will either roll on automatically via time or manually via keypress.</p>
<h2>How to install</h2>
<ol>
<li>Download the two scripts and place them in a directory e.g. "~/.scripts"</li>
<li>Make them executable</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to use</h2>
<h3>mpv</h3>
<ol>
<li>Start mpv and the song you want to listen to</li>
<li>Run the script with ~/.scripts/lyricsFormat</li>
<li>Enjoy the lyrics inside your terminal</li>
</ol>
<p>If you just want the lyrics to autoroll, change the commented lines in "lyricsFormat"s source.</p>
<h2>Ideas</h2>
<p>If someone can think of a way to sync the lyrics, please share your idea! I thought about looking up the BPM, but i don't think it will work anyway. But nevertheless, you can just press a button instead to get the right timing! :)</p>
<p>Have fun.</p>
